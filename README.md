## Inspiration

MindSupportAI was inspired by our shared passion for leveraging AI to address critical social issues. Mental health, being an area of profound impact on individuals' lives, motivated us to create a solution that offers genuine care and compassion, breaking down barriers and reducing the stigma around mental health care.

## How we built it

To develop MindSupportAI, we combined our expertise in AI, natural language processing, and machine learning. Leveraging the powerful GPT-3.5 language model, we process user input and generate meaningful responses. Integration with ElevenLab TTS software ensures the AI therapist delivers comforting and empathetic interactions.
